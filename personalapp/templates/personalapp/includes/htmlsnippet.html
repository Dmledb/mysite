  <div class="col-sm-8"> <p>Anthem will be released on February 22, 2019. It will be developed by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts for Xbox One, PS4, and PC.
Anthem is a shared-world action-RPG, where players can delve into a vast world teeming with amazing technology and forgotten treasures. The world is also filled with savage beasts and ruthless marauders where Freelancers are called to defeat the forces plotting to conquer humanity. Up to four friends can unravel the world's mysteries and take on its most fearsome challenges together. Shared danger means shared glory, and successful Freelancers will all be richly rewarded for successful exploits. Throughout their adventure, players can outfit their Freelancers with powerful Javelin exosuits, each of which are equipped with unique weapons and abilities. Players can also customize their Javelin with gear they earn and craft throughout the adventure, and leave a lasting mark on the world.</></div>
